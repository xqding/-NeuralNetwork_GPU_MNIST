# A CUDA Parallel Implementation of Feed Forward Neural Networks for MNIST Recognition on GPU

## Description
This is an implementation of feed forward neural networks for recogniting the MNIST. It is written in C++ with CUDA. 
The feed forward neural network comprises one input layer with 28X28 neurons, several hidden layers and a softmax layer.
In the main.cpp file, you can specify the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each hidden year.
